  <h3>The History of American Fashion</h3>
  <p> The beauty of American fashion lies in that it reflects the shifts and changes within America. It mirrors societal trends and events and intertwines different cultural influences. The History of Aerican Fashion exhibit aims to capture and deliver some of the endless number of trends that have shaped American fashion.</p>

  <p>American fashion has always been a reflection of different cultural aspects, but in particular, it has reflected the country’s spirit and cultural diversity, especially after becoming known as a melting pot. From the iconic styles of the Jazz Age to the rebellious spirit of the 1960s counterculture to the rise of streetwear and sustainable fashion, the evolution of American fashion showcases both continuity and innovation.</p>

  <p>In the past few centuries, American fashion has evolved in countless different ways. In this museum, we explore the evolution of clothing styles, trends, and cultural influences that have shaped American fashion. We hope to educate and engage visitors about the nature of American fashion and to foster a deeper appreciation for the meaning behind fashion trends. </p>

        Early European Americans lacked many of the fancy accessories such as brocades and fancy lace in their clothing due to the distance from Europe. Men wore breeches and coats made of deerskin and buckskin, and women wore simple gowns. People valued durability over fashion during this time; cloth was made with flax, cotton, and wool.

      The Romantic Era

    <div class="header-desc">
      The post Enlightenment Romantic Era was seen in many aspects of American culture at the time, including music, art, design, and architecture. The period took inspiration from gothic and neoclassical influences and can be considered a transition period from early American fashion to Victorian fashion.

        During the early days of the Romantic Era, the empire silhouette was a popular trend, which featured a high waistline in women’s dresses. As the decades progressed, women began to lean towards fuller sleeves and skirts. Women wore multiple layers of petticoats and a bustle pad to hold up the wider skirt, and mantles were worn over fancier evening dresses.

        The Romantic Era also marked the beginning of corsetry in America. During this era, American fashion began to adopt an hourglass trend. Corsets during the Romantic Era sought to bring out the natural figure; later in the Victorian Era, corsets would become tools to shape rather than accentuate.

      The Victorian Era

    <div class="header-desc">
      The Victorian Era was perhaps the most well known fashion era in history. Fashion during this time period was characterized by the dramatic appearance of women’s clothing; from full skirts that exaggerated silhouettes to corsets that cinched waists so tight that women had difficulty breathing.

        Corsets and full skirts were the hallmarks of the Victorian Era [VAM UK source]. Women wore corsets nearly their entire lives in order to get the “18 inch waist” and hourglass figure that women at the time desired. Even during pregnancy and motherhood, women would wear corsets made for pregnancy and breastfeeding. Young girls at the time would get placed into corsets as well [FORBES SOURCE].

      World War 1 and Jazz Age fashion were heavily influenced by the US situation at the time.

        During World War 1, fashion became more standardized and simplified as a result of department stores, which allowed more people to purchase standard items. The US supported the allies during the war which resulted in an influence from allied nations such as France, even before the US joined the war efforts. Fashion during this era was simplified and became duller in colors in an effort to save fabric and resources. As a result, clothing became more uniform-like and carried less ornamentation.

        Following WW1, many African Americans moved to the northern cities.

Women’s hair was cut to bob or eton crop styles to complement the trending cloche hats.

          Hippie fashion became a form of expression for many activists at the time. The trend incorporated artisan clothing instead of that made by department stores. Clothes were sewn, knit, or woven using macrame and cotton or hemp were the most common materials, which emphazied the goal to return closer to nature. Floral or tie-dye patterns were very common; tie-dye was especially popular because it could be done by hand. Women wore colorful skirts and dresses, in a wide variety of lengths. Men and women wore peasant blouses, t-shirts, jeans with fringed ankles or bell bottoms. During the Vietnam war, symbols of peace also became popular and starting becoming incorporated into fashion trends.

    <div class="header-desc">
        The most recent fashion trend is known as street fashion or streetwear, a form of casual clothing that has been globally popularized in the past few decades. The casual style takes a mix of different styles from the all around, from 80s styles to New York hip hop culture to California surfwear. <br> <br>
        The idea behind the casual streetwear style is to let the new generations be more expressive and not be bound by a norm. There’s no specific style that people are expected to follow, which allows them to choose how they want to express themselves. This pairs well with the recent political movements regarding rights for typically marginalized groups, examples being the LGBTQ+ movement, abortion rights protests, and the BLM movement; Americans want to be able to be themselves and not be bound by laws or stigmas that restrict them.

        Many trends from past eras have made a comeback during the Streetwear era. One example is corsetry; recently, designers have taken a spin on the Romantic and Victorian Era corsets and turned them into a more casual version that Gen-Z and Millenial consumers would wear. Many popular brands that Americans visit such as American Eagle and even Versace now sell this revamped historical style.

        The rise in demand to keep up with the trends has had some detrimental effects. Recently, the problems related to the rise of fast fashion has been brought to attention; although fast fashion is a cheap way to keep up, it is at the expense of unfair labor in sweatshops and many tons of material waste. It also has a large carbon footprint at roughly 10% of global emissions. <br> <br>
        The problem with the rising demand for trendy clothing is that many people don’t recognize the trade-off. Although recently brands have begun to invest in sustainable fashion practice, society still has a ways to go before fast fashion consequences are minimized.
